# Incremental Neural Networks for Non-Stationary Time Series

This repository contains an implementation of an Incremental LSTM
for learning from non-stationary time-series data, with an application
to the Electricity dataset.

## Structure
- src/ — core implementation
- experiments/ — runnable experiment scripts
- data/ — datasets
